Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks
Computer vision (audio/vdo/img) -> Image classification (binary and multiclass)
Datasets from Kaggle
Aim: To know more about conv layers and training a model in neural nets. Basic building blocks for upcoming great ideas. 


#Panda Bear Classification  (for learning purposes mainly)
First attempt: predicted classes train and test data set
Second attempt: added validation set and formed a confusion matrix


#Weather Change  (Vision: safety from sudden weather changes thru alerts/alarms)
First attempt: predicted classes train and test data set
Second attempt: added validation set and formed a confusion matrix
Third commit: linked file directly with colab and added the most accurate prediction till now
